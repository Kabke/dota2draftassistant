For the uninitiated, Dota 2 is a highly-competitive online computer game. Each Dota 2 match is in a 5v5 format where each player selects 1 hero from a list of 119 heroes. Each hero has unique abilities, and thus, strategy is immensely important during the phase of the game where heroes are selected. This project is meant to assist in a player's decision making while selecting their hero. First the program identifies the desired play style of the player via text input. Secondly the program scrapes this week's win-rate for every hero in Dota 2. Third the program prints out a list of the top 20 most-winning heroes that fit play style selected by the player. This allows the player to immediately identify which heroes are strong in the meta for any given role in Dota 2.
